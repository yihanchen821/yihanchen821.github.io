        <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Ibuprofen is a popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for analgesic,<br>anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic purposes. However, it has reported cardiac risks in<br>patients, while its mechanism of the side effect is still underexplored. This article discusses<br>how Ibuprofen is related to cardiovascular diseases in cardiac cells, rabbits, guinea pigs, and<br>dogs in previous studies, and how it contributes to the arrhythmia generation.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>(NSAIDs) in the world. It is well known for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic<br>effects. It has a short term effect for acute diseases such as headache, menstrual pain,<br>toothache etc. Ibuprofen also has a long term effect for chronic diseases like rheumatoid<br>arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Apart from that, there’s a rare usage of<br>Ibuprofen in PDA treatment for pediatric patients1. It has also been widely used due to its<br>higher efficiency and safety compared to acetaminophen and aspirin (commonly known as<br>Tynol), respectively.</p>
<p>Most of the Ibuprofen is taken orally, but it is also approved for the usage of<br>intravenous injection. It can be fast absorbed when taken orally and will reach a maximum<br>concentration in plasma at 1-2 hours (tmax 1-2h). However, Ibuprofen has a low distribution<br>volume which is similar to plasma volume(~0.1-0.21&#x2F;kg)1. Additionally, Ibuprofen has a short<br>half-life(t1&#x2F;2, ~1-3h), which also explains why it is usually suggested to be taken every 6-8<br>hours. Ibuprofen is also a lipid soluble molecule and a weak acid, so there’s no need for<br>transporters while it’s entering the cells.</p>
<p>NSAIDs are cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors that have two isoforms COX-1 and<br>COX-22. Some recent clinical studies have shown that at any dose and with any<br>cardiovascular disease backgrounds, NSAIDs could cause a huge increase in risk of<br>myocardial infarction (MI)3. As a popular NSAID drug, ibuprofen has been found to have an<br>association with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, the mechanism of its negative<br>impact on heart health remains largely unidentified. Therefore, in this study, we will review<br>past research and propose possible mechanisms by which ibuprofen affects the heart.</p>
<ol>
<li>COX-2 inhibition is detrimental to cardiovascular health</li>
</ol>
<p>Patients administered with selective COX-2 inhibitors are likely to have five times<br>higher risks of MI and two times higher risks of thromboembolus. Additionally, selective<br>COX-2 inhibition causes CVD, reduces cardiac output, and increases arrhythmogenesis3.<br>Notebly, Ibuprofen has been shown to increase the risk of MI and heart failure even within a<br>week. From histological studies, rats treated by ibuprofen showed prominent vascular<br>obstruction and signs of pericardial inflammation in their hearts4. The alterations in the<br>cardiac tissue structure are consistent with higher risks of MI and thromboembolism from<br>clinical data.</p>
<p>In an in vitro study, rat cardiac H9c2 cells presented affected mitochondrial functions<br>and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production5. The high level of ROS is<br>associated with DNA damage and cellular apoptosis, which may be a possible mechanism<br>behind cardiac risks.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ibuprofen elicited ventricular arrhythmias in guinea pigs</li>
</ol>
<p>In a past study used guinea pigs and rabbits to study the electrophysiological effect<br>of ibuprofen on animal hearts6. In guinea pigs, ibuprofen was found to elongate QRS<br>duration and RR intervals after injecting ibuprofen, while QT was decreased with a<br>significant change. Additionally, four guinea pigs out of six presented ventricular fibrillation<br>after ibuprofen administration. Ex vivo tests of isolated guinea pig hearts showed similar<br>results, which confirmed cardiotoxicity of ibuprofen on hearts. Further characterization of<br>action potential (AP) of guinea pig heart tissues showed reduced AP duration, which is a risk<br>factor for re-entry generation. The decreased maximum depolarization velocity (Vmax) also<br>correlates to decreased conduction propagation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ibuprofen has strong influence on electrophysiology in rabbit sinus nodes and<br>ventricles</li>
</ol>
<p>Some studies on rabbit hearts also showed adverse effects of ibuprofen on the heart<br>electrophysiology6. When the concentration of ibuprofen reaches 80 mg&#x2F;L, Vmax, beating<br>rate, and depolarization rate all decrease significantly, which may lead to sinus bradycardia.<br>Consistently, in an ex vivo perfusion study of rabbit hearts, ibuprofen decreased APD at 90%<br>repolarization (APD90) by 10% compared to the baseline7. From their study, QRS duration<br>and RR interval increased, but QT decreased by 20%, which means a shorter effective<br>refractory period (ERP) in ventricles. Compared to the baseline, Ibuprofen at 30 μM also<br>shortened the ERP by 10ms. Rabbit hearts had higher arrhythmia vulnerability with<br>increasing dosage of ibuprofen. However, the dispersion of repolarization was not<br>significantly influenced by ibuprofen.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Ibuprofen has arrhythmic effects on dog Purkinje fibers</li>
</ol>
<p>In another study of the effects of ibuprofen on action potentials recorded from<br>superfused dog Purkinje fibers, the isolated Purkinje fibers had a significant decrease in<br>APD90 when Ibuprofen was 200 μM, which suggests shortened repolarization8. The Vmax of<br>Purkinje AP also significantly decreased at different cycle lengths. In contrast, 200 μM<br>ibuprofen decreased the amplitude of transient outward potassium current (Ito) which is<br>crucial at the early stage of repolarization. The decreased Ito caused elongated<br>repolarization. From the results, the increased dispersion of APD and decreased Vmax in<br>ventricles are both risk factors of ventricular arrhythmias. However, the ibuprofen level used<br>in this study was abnormally high to produce significant differences, as its peak<br>concentration in human plasma is around 121 μM by normal intake9. It may be due to the<br>superfusion setup which is less efficient for the tissues to uptake ibuprofen.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-and-discussion"><a href="#Conclusion-and-discussion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion and discussion"></a>Conclusion and discussion</h2><p>Based on all the previous studies, we can conclude that, despite positive effects of<br>ibuprofen on inflammation and pain, it has pronounced risks of cardiovascular incidences in<br>all in-vitro, in-vivo, and ex-vivo models. Because of its adverse effects on cardiac<br>electrophysiology and histology, we can expect that patients having long-term ibuprofen<br>uptake are prone to have arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Although past studies have already revealed functional changes induced by<br>ibuprofen, it is challenging to translate these findings from animal models to human subjects.<br>Additionally, there are a limited number of studies on human hearts, which impedes our<br>understanding. Therefore, future research should require more human-derived models, such<br>as stem cell-derived engineered hearts, to accomplish a deeper mechanistic insight into the<br>relationship between ibuprofen and human hearts.</p>
